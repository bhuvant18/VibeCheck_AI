# 🛡️ HallucinationCheck AI - AI Hallucination Detector

## 🔍 Problem Statement: AI Hallucination & Citation Verification

Generative AI systems frequently produce confident yet factually incorrect content, including fabricated claims. A major risk is the generation of fake citations, non-existent references, and unverifiable sources. Such outputs undermine trust, reliability, and ethical use of AI-generated information. Users currently lack effective tools to verify factual accuracy and citation validity in AI responses. This project aims to detect, flag, and verify claims and citations to distinguish reliable AI output from hallucinations.
